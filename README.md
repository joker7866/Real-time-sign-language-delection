# Real-time-sign-language-delection
Real-Time Sign Language Detection This project focuses on developing a real-time sign language detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging models such as CNNs and LSTMs, alongside OpenCV for live video processing, the system accurately interprets sign language gestures dynamically.

## Overview
This project is designed to recognize and interpret sign language gestures dynamically using deep learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging models such as CNNs and LSTMs, alongside OpenCV for live video processing, the system aims to enhance accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
